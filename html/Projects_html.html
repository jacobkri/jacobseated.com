      <h2>Beamtic</h2>
      <p><b>Beamtic</b> is a successful tutorial site with around <i class="fire">50.000</i> visitors per month. I
        coded the CMS myself from the ground up, and I am trying to migrate some of the code to GitHub. I use the CMS
        for related personal projects.</p>
      <p><b>Why not use Wordpress or Drupal rather than creating your own CMS?</b></p>
      <p>Both Wordpress and Drupal has, historically, been plagued by security problems. Scripts exists to scan for
        known vulnerabilities, and bots tend to scan websites at random. I do have a Drupal site, but it has been
        hacked several times.</p>
      <p>Security is not my main reason for creating my own CMS. I mainly did it to learn, and once my CMS reached a
        fairly high level, I realized it was much better than using existing solutions, since I am in full control of
        everything.</p>

      <h2>PHP Photo Gallery</h2>
      <p><b>PHP Photo Gallery</b> was created because I needed a simple photo gallery, and since I was unable to find
        any free Wordpress plugins at the time, I got angry and decided to make my own gallery using build-in
        capabilities of PHP.</p>

      <p>The project is fully open source, and is <a href="https://github.com/beamtic/php-photo-gallery">available on
          GitHub</a>.</p>

      <p>You can also check out the demo on the website. One of my friends is a photographer, and is using it on his
        own website: <a href="https://ccmpixart.dk/">ccmpixart.dk</a></p>
