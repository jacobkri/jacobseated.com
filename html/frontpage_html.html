  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>I like to create things to solve problems and make life easier for myself and for other people.</p>
  <p>Since I like to create, and watch things grow, one day I would love to either join a startup or build my own
    company.</p>
  <p>This website was created from the ground-up to showcase some of my work, and to demonstrate my
    coding-skills. The code for the CMS behind this website is available at GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/jacobkri/jacobseated.com">https://github.com/jacobkri/jacobseated.com</a>,
    and is available under Apache license. Credits for photos used on the site goes to <b>Christian Mercier</b>.</p>
  <p>Use the top navigation to see examples of things I have made. <b>Highlighted Projects</b> can be found on the <b>Projects</b>
    page.</p>
<p class="indent"><strong>Note.</strong> This site is still a work-in-progress, and I may not have included my KEA projects yet. They will likely get their own dedicated page, including information on my design-process, sketches, wireframes and other relevant stuff.</p>

  <h2>My Superpowers</h2>
  <p>I have a broad set of skills with a <b>&lt;strong&gt;</b> focus on coding, and most things to do with Web
    Development. I am also very creative, and I know how to use several different programs for video and photo editing.</p>
  <p>Since my main operating system is now Linux (dual boot with Windows), I have learned to use Open Source programs
    such as: <i>LibreOffice</i>, <i>OBS</i>, <i>Handbrake</i>, <i>Gimp</i> and <i>Kdenlive</i>. But, I am also able to
    use "industry standard" Adobe CC, including <i>Photoshop</i>, <i>Premiere</i>, <i>Illustrator</i> and <i>InDesign</i>.
    <p>I am also familiar with <i>3D Studio MAX</i>, although I have not used it for many years. However, it has given
      me a feel with 3D modeling and Animation, which might be useful at some point.</p>
    <p>Some years ago, I used to make animated Gifs. But, I have since moved on to animated SVGs using CSS and
      JavaScript.</p>
    <p>When I work, I am usually very independent. I solve problems on my own, and come up with my own solutions. I
      learned early on to use Google before asking questions. It seems like a good approach. Though sometimes it may be
      faster to just ask.</p>

  <h2>The History</h2>
  <p>I started coding and creating websites as a kid, first using plain <b>notepad</b> in Windows, later moving on to
    editors with <i>Syntax Highlighting</i>. Now, I mainly use Linux with <b>Eclipse</b> and <b>Visual Studio Code</b>.</p>

  <p><b>January 2013</b> I decided to seak an unpaid internship for a few months as a Web Developer. Doing this time, I
    was allowed to improve my existing skills with <i>HTML</i>, <i>CSS</i>, <i>JavaScript</i> and <i>PHP</i>.</p>
  <p>In addition, I also learned more about <i>Linux</i>, how to use <i>AWS (Amazon Web Services)</i>, <i>Git</i>, and
    <i>Bootstrap</i>.</p>
  <p>It was doing this time I decided to go back to school to get an education. However, first I had to finish high
    school, which took me a few years. This is required to join higher education in Denmark.</p>

  <p><b>October 2017</b> I started studying <i>Multimedia Design and Communication</i> at <i>KEA</i> (Copenhagen School
    of Design and Technology), and expect to complete my education on time.</p>
  <p>This education has a broad focus, covering many of my existing interests. Including <i>video editing</i>, <i>marketing</i>,
    <i>business</i>, <i>SEO</i> and <i>web development</i>.</p>
