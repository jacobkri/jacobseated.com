          <h2>About</h2>
          <p>My interests are currently in technology and business, and I like to create things to solve problems and make life easier for myself and other people. Another interest i have is <i>investing</i> in <i>stocks</i>.</p></p>
          <p>One day I would love to join a startup or build my own company.</p>
          <p>This website was created to showcase some of my work. Use the top navigation to see examples of things I have made. My main projects are linked from the <a href="/#projects">My Projects</a> section.</p>

          <h2>My Superpowers</h2>
          <p>I have a broad set of skills with a <b>&lt;strong&gt;</b> focus on coding, and most things to do with Web Development.
             I am also very creative, and I know how to use several different programs for video and photo editing.</p>
          <p>Since my main operating system is now Linux (dual boot with Windows), I have learned to use Open Source programs such as: <i>LibreOffice</i>, <i>OBS</i>, <i>Handbrake</i>, <i>Gimp</i> and <i>Kdenlive</i>.
          But, I am also able to use "industry standard" Adobe CC, including <i>Photoshop</i>, <i>Premiere</i>, <i>Illustrator</i> and <i>InDesign</i>.
          <p>I am also familier with <i>3D Studio MAX</i>, although I have not used it for many years. However, it has given me a feel with 3D modeling and Animation, which might be useful at some point.</p>
          <p>Some years ago, I used to make animated Gifs. But, I have since moved on to animated SVGs using CSS and JavaScript.</p>
          <p>When I work, I am usually very independent. I solve problems on my own, and come up with my own solutions.
             I learned early on to use Google before asking questions. It seems like a good approach. Though sometimes it may be faster to just ask.</p>

          <h2>The History</h2>
          <p>I started coding and creating websites as a kid, first using plain <b>notepad</b> in Windows, later moving on to editors with <i>Syntax Highlighting</i>.
          Now, I mainly use Linux with <b>Eclipse</b> and <b>Visual Studio Code</b>.</p>

          <p><b>January 2013</b> I decided to seak an unpaid internship for a few months as a Web Developer. Doing this time,
             I was allowed to improve my existing skills with <i>HTML</i>, <i>CSS</i>, <i>JavaScript</i> and <i>PHP</i>.</p>
          <p>In addition, I also learned more about <i>Linux</i>, how to use <i>AWS (Amazon Web Services)</i>, <i>Git</i>, and <i>Bootstrap</i>.</p>
          <p>It was doing this time I decided to go back to school to get an education. However, first I had to finish high school, which took me a few years. This is required to join higher education in Denmark.</p>

          <p><b>October 2017</b> I started studying <i>Multimedia Design and Communication</i> at <i>KEA</i> (Copenhagen School of Design and Technology),
             and expect to complete my education on time.</p>
          <p>This education has a broad focus, including many of my existing interests. Including <i>video</i>, <i>marketing</i>, <i>business</i>, and <i>web development</i>.</p>
