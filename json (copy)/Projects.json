Scripts exists to scan for\r\n        known vulnerabilities, and bots tend to scan websites at random. I do have a Drupal site, but it has been\r\n        hacked several times.<\/p>\r\n      <p>Security is not my main reason for creating my own CMS. I mainly did it to learn, and once my CMS reached a\r\n        fairly high level, I realized it was much better than using existing solutions, since I am in full control of\r\n        everything.<\/p>\r\n    <\/div>\r\n  <\/section>\r\n\r\n  <section class=\"fade_in_delayed projects_content_wrap\">\r\n    <div class=\"projects_content_inner_wrap\">\r\n      <h2>PHP Photo Gallery<\/h2>\r\n      <p><b>PHP Photo Gallery<\/b> was created because I needed a simple photo gallery, and since I was unable to find\r\n        any free Wordpress plugins at the time, I got angry and decided to make my own gallery using build-in\r\n        capabilities of PHP.<\/p>\r\n\r\n      <p>The project is fully open source, and is <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/beamtic\/php-photo-gallery\">available on\r\n          GitHub<\/a>.<\/p>\r\n\r\n      <p>You can also check out the demo on the website.
